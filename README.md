## 💖 Favorite Piece of Code 👨‍💻

![Favorite Piece of Code](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a87e25f1-a7bf-4ce5-a6fd-32ce82a6e39f)

This is my favorite piece of code because of how **simple** it is — yet it brings **all the hard work I did to life**.  
After writing so many classes and methods, seeing this little snippet **tie everything together** into a full, working torta order...  
It’s like watching your code *serve up a masterpiece*. 🌟🥪
